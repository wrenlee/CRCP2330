/**
	Welcome to the Fireworks game!

	The objective of the game is to catch the rogue firework in a box before it explodes. 
	The firework will bounce off the edges of the screen. 

	You control the box with the left and right keys on the keyboard. Left key = the box moves left and vice versa. 
	If the box goes off the screen, the box will be reset to the middle.
	
	If the e key is pressed or the firework is caught, the game ends.

	Good luck!
